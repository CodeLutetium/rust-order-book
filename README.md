# Simple Order Book Implementation with Rust
An [order book](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order-book.asp) is an electronic registry of buy and sell orders organized by price level for specific securities. This project aims to mimic a simple one that keeps tracks of orders and transactions.

# Long term plan
The long term plan is to persist the orders and transactions in a postgres database, and allow orders to be made through API calls or webhooks.
